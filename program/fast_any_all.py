import numpy as np

# Purpose: 
# np.any and np.all are quite slow - about 15x slower than using logical_or and logical_and calls
# This code tries to combine the best features of np.logical_and/or and np.any/all. 
# It takes lists of arrays (like np.any/all), but is fast like np.logical_or/and
# It doesn't have the flexibility (in terms of axis choice) that is offered by np.any/all. 

"""This module offers a very fast alternative to numpy.any/all, for the use case of a list of bool ndarrays"""
