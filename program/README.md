- gbb_gdal_calc  is drawn from gbb's modified version at github, plus one line to import simpleselect
- simpleselect is taken from gbb's version at github
- fast-any-all is taken from gbb's version at github

in future, hopefully both of these will be standard features in numpy and gdal, and they don't need to
be seperately included in rbuild

- misc_functions is helper functions
- build_functions is actions that can be taken by rbuild
