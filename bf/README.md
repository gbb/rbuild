Use of folders:
----

- personal buildfiles, project buildfiles and special purpose buildfiles 
and their related sub-files, can be stored under "projects", in an appropriate place

- 'generally useful' and easily re-usable files are stored in "standard". 
- please follow the naming convention e.g. performance_, map_, ... 

- default.bf is the only bf file that should be kept in the root folder

- "tests" is used for development purposes to test rbuild
